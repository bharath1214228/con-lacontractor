										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="has-text">Is your bathroom looking a little down in the dumps? Could it use a glow-up?</p>
<p class="has-text">Follow this guide to the best DIY bathroom remodels to turn your bathroom into an asset on a budget.</p>
<h2 class="has-text">How to Remodel a Bathroom In 6 Steps</h2>
<h3 class="has-text">1. Remove Bathroom Fixtures</h3>
<p class="has-text">If you&#8217;re planning a <span class="mark-keyword">DIY bathroom remodel</span>, one of the first things you&#8217;ll need to do is remove the old bathroom fixtures. This can be a bit tricky, depending on what type of fixtures you have, but with a little patience and some careful planning, you should be able to get the job done without too much trouble.</p>
<p class="has-text">Start by turning off the water to the bathroom. This will prevent any accidental flooding while you&#8217;re working. Next, remove any hardware from the fixtures, such as faucets and handles. If possible, it&#8217;s also a good idea to take a few photos of the fixtures so you&#8217;ll know how to put them back together when it&#8217;s time to install the new ones.</p>
<p class="has-text">Once the fixtures are removed, you can start working on removing the actual bathroom vanity. This will likely be the most challenging part of the project, so take your time and be careful not to damage any of the pipes or connections. Once the vanity is out, you can begin installing the new one.</p>
<p class="has-text">With the old fixtures and vanity out of the way, the rest of the bathroom remodel should be a breeze. Just be sure to take your time and follow all the instructions carefully, and you should be able to complete the project in no time at all.</p>
<h4 class="has-text">Tips for Gutting a Bathroom:</h4>
<p class="has-text">Before gutting your bathroom, make sure you have a solid plan in place. This means having a clear vision for what you want your new bathroom to look like, and what type of fixtures and finishes you want to use.</p>
<p class="has-text">Once you have a plan, start by gutting your bathroom one section at a time. This will help to avoid any major disruptions to your daily routine.</p>
<p class="has-text">When gutting your bathroom, be sure to protect your floors and walls from any potential damage. This can be done by covering them with plastic sheeting or old towels.</p>
<p class="has-text">Once you have gutted your bathroom, take the time to thoroughly clean the space. This will help to ensure that your new bathroom is free of any dirt or debris.</p>
<p class="has-text">When installing new fixtures and finishes in your bathroom, be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully. This will help to ensure that your new bathroom is installed correctly and looks its best.</p>
<h3 class="has-text">2. Install the New Shower or Tub</h3>
<p class="has-text">Installing a new shower or tub fixture is a great way to update the look of your bathroom. If you&#8217;re not sure how to do it yourself, there are plenty of resources available online or at your local hardware store. Be sure to turn off the water to your bathroom before starting the project, and follow the instructions carefully to avoid any accidents.</p>
<h3 class="has-text">3. Lay the New Flooring</h3>
<p class="has-text">If you’re planning on redoing your bathroom floor, lay the new flooring before you do anything else. This will save you from having to work around fixtures and will make the job go faster. You’ll also want to make sure that the new flooring is compatible with the rest of the room. For example, if you have a tile bathroom, you probably won’t want to put in hardwood floors.</p>
<h3 class="has-text">4. Hang Drywall and Start Painting</h3>
<p class="has-text">One project you can do is to hang drywall and start painting. This will freshen up the look of your bathroom and make it feel new. Plus, it’s a project that you can do over a weekend.</p>
<p class="has-text">To hang drywall, you will need to measure the walls and cut the drywall to size. Then, using drywall screws, attach the drywall to the studs in the walls. Once the drywall is up, you can start painting. Choose a light color to paint the walls and a dark color to paint the trim. You can also add a new shower curtain and towels to complete the look.</p>
<h3 class="has-text">5. Install Cabinets and Vanity</h3>
<p class="has-text">This can be a tricky task, so it&#8217;s important to take your time and measure twice before you cut once. It&#8217;s also a good idea to ask a friend or family member for help if you&#8217;re not confident in your ability to do the job yourself. Once the cabinets and vanity are installed, you can move on to other aspects of the remodel, like painting, tiling, and fixtures.</p>
<h3 class="has-text">6. Update Lighting</h3>
<p class="has-text">Updating your lighting is one of the easiest and most effective ways to give your bathroom a new look. You can find <span class="mark-keyword">affordable</span> new fixtures at most <span class="mark-keyword">home improvement</span> stores. Be sure to choose fixtures that complement the other elements in your bathroom, such as the sink, tub, and toilet.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>There are many different ways that you can update the lighting in your bathroom, but if you want to ensure that the job is done correctly, you should call our excellent team at Joel &amp; Co. Company. We have a team of experts who can remodel your bathroom.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Choosing the right home renovation contractor can make a huge difference in the outcome of your project. Whether you want to <a href="https://losangelesgeneralcontractor.com/bathroom-remodeling/">upgrade your bathrooms</a>, <a href="https://losangelesgeneralcontractor.com/kitchen-remodeling/">remodel your kitchen</a> or give your <a href="https://losangelesgeneralcontractor.com/room-additions/">living room a modern look</a>, there’s a lot of work that goes into transforming your renovation and remodeling ideas into stylish interior spaces that meet your needs and goals.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re new to finding, vetting and hiring the right home renovation contractor for your project in Los Angeles, you’ll have to contend with the huge number of contractors offering services. How do you pick from the top general contractors in Los Angeles? To make sure you’re getting the <a href="https://www.houselogic.com/remodel/budgeting-contracting/getting-best-work-contractor/">best work from a general contractor</a>, here are a few expert considerations to keep in mind.</p>
<p><strong>Do Your Homework</strong></p>
<p>To find the best home general contractor, you need to do your homework. While you can search for the most reputable contractors offering services in your area through the internet, talking to people you trust like your friends or neighbors who have previously hired home renovation experts can help you get names of contractors who’ve proven reliable in their work. The most important thing when getting recommendations is ensuring you get genuine leads.</p>
<p>Always consider getting a few referrals from people you know, read online reviews of top general contractors in Los Angeles, check their certifications and be sure that they’re licensed and insured. Just like in any other skill-based profession, the best home renovation experts work through referrals. Thanks to our proven reliability and workmanship, we often rely on referrals to get more work from satisfied customers.</p>
<p><strong>Know What You Want</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2318 aligncenter" src="https://losangelesgeneralcontractor.com//nas/content/live/joelco/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Plan-your-home.jpg" alt="Plan your home" width="810" height="540" srcset="https://joelco.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Plan-your-home.jpg 810w, https://joelco.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Plan-your-home-300x200.jpg 300w, https://joelco.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Plan-your-home-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px" /></p>
<p>Before you even look for a home renovation contractor, you should have a pretty good idea of what services you want. Is it basement renovation, a kitchen remodel or home addition? According to an expert guide on <a href="http://www.housebeautiful.com/home-remodeling/renovation/q-and-a/a3370/how-to-prepare-for-a-remodel/">how to prepare for a home remodel</a>, it’s important to organize your ideas and thoughts so that the contractor can understand what you want to accomplish.</p>
<p>Outline every relevant detail for your renovation project. The more specifics you provide, the easier it will be for the contractor to meet your needs and provide accurate estimates. Getting price estimates can be a tricky affair if you&#8217;re not thorough in your details. Even the most experienced contractors cannot provide accurate estimates if you leave out some information.</p>
<p>Be clear about your home renovation needs, materials and goals. If you want a particular type of flooring material for your living room or modern design for your kitchen countertop, communicate that clearly. Top general contractors in Los Angeles, including our team of experts, are willing to provide the necessary guidance and advice and also suggest affordable options where necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on Project Management Expertise</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not always about your project but also about the way the home contractor works. Sometimes, you may be torn between two home renovation contractors who have a record of delivering excellent results. How do you select the best one? Try to find out how they work and their project management process. The keys to any successful renovation project are good planning, reliable <a href="http://buildingadvisor.com/project-management/">project management</a> and good communication with your team.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2319 aligncenter" src="https://losangelesgeneralcontractor.com//nas/content/live/joelco/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Project-management.jpg" alt="Project management" width="810" height="520" srcset="https://joelco.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Project-management.jpg 810w, https://joelco.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Project-management-300x193.jpg 300w, https://joelco.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Project-management-768x493.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px" /></p>
<p>Do they keep you informed at every stage of the project? Do they have a streamlined process for completing projects? Are their skilled workers professional? How do they prepare the work area and leave it after completing the project? At Joel &amp; Co. Construction, our team goes a long way to ensure that you&#8217;re satisfied with our services.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluate Completed Renovation Projects</strong></p>
<p>Check previously completed home renovation projects. Don&#8217;t assume that a highly experienced contractor will deliver the type of results you want. Viewing photos of specific projects they have handled like kitchen, basement and bathroom renovations can help you determine if their renovation style matches your project goals and needs.</p>
<p>Remember that every remodeling or renovation project is unique in its own way. A contractor may be experienced in modern renovations but lack the skills in working around traditional architectural or interior decor projects. For example, we have <a href="https://losangelesgeneralcontractor.com/gallery/">an extensive gallery</a> featuring some of our favorite pictures from recently completed projects throughout Southern California.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve finally decided to go ahead with that room addition you’ve always wanted, and like many people, you have decided to hire a room addition contractor in Los Angeles to perform the work. The process of planning and completing a room addition to your home is no small feat. Before you even think of hiring a contractor, you should have developed a basic written plan, with clear thoughts and ideas of what you want in your room addition.</p>
<p>Flow and design are key to ensuring successful a room addition that meets your lifestyle needs and design requirements, and this is best done by consulting an experienced design and build contractor to assist you in the project. Finding the best match for your <a href="https://losangelesgeneralcontractor.com/room-additions/">room addition in Los Angeles</a> is key to transforming your room addition plans and ideas into reality.</p>
<p>Read our advice for selecting the right room addition <a href="https://losangelesgeneralcontractor.com/contact/">contractor and consider contacting Joel &amp; Co. Construction</a> for your next project!</p>
<p><strong>Choose an Established Local Contractor</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to handling any home addition project, you need to work with a well-established local contractor who will manage all aspects of your home addition, including design, obtaining the necessary building permits, supervising the construction work, building teams, and scheduling work inspections.</p>
<p>How do you ensure everything is handled professionally? A seasoned contractor will simplify the project management process by providing an experienced project manager who you can communicate with and is accountable for your room addition project. What do you look for when hiring a local room addition contractor in Los Angeles?</p>
<ul>
<li>A high level of experience. How many years have they been in business?</li>
<li>An impressive track record of successfully completing home addition projects.</li>
<li>Valid license and liability and worker’s compensation insurance.</li>
<li>Examples of room additions they have completed recently.</li>
<li>Genuine references. Get feedback from past clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you conduct your research, make sure to shortlist contractors who are the best fit for your specific project. Ask questions about how they handle common customer concerns and issues. In general, you want to select a contractor who has the applicable experience in the specific type of room addition you want and a strong commitment to delivering to your expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Make Sure They Have a Skilled Team to Handle Your Project</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2320 aligncenter" src="https://losangelesgeneralcontractor.com//nas/content/live/joelco/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Skilled-contractors.jpg" alt="Skilled contractors" width="810" height="508" srcset="https://joelco.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Skilled-contractors.jpg 810w, https://joelco.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Skilled-contractors-300x188.jpg 300w, https://joelco.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Skilled-contractors-768x482.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px" /></p>
<p>To ensure smooth project management, from planning to completion, you must make sure you have the right team. A reliable room addition contractor in Los Angeles will have an experienced designer to facilitate the design of your home addition and the planning process. In most cases, many homeowners have no idea about what they want until someone provides a design. Expect a designer to ask you questions to determine how you plan to use your new space and what’s most important to you.</p>
<p>Your answers will guide the design process in coming up with a complete plan of what your room addition will look like when complete. Once this is done, it’s important to have a fully integrated team focused on the room addition design, pre-construction work, planning, construction and project operations. A good contractor will work with minimal disruptions in your home.</p>
<p>According to a Homeadvisor article, the <a href="https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/additions-and-remodels/build-an-addition/">national average cost of building an addition</a> stands at $42,074. With this amount, it’s easy to see why you need a room addition contractor in Los Angeles with a reliable and skilled team to handle your project. Otherwise, you may end having a shoddy job and wasting your money on an addition that doesn’t meet your needs.</p>
<p><strong>Ask Questions</strong></p>
<p>To make sure you’re working with the right team, you need to ask the right questions to help you evaluate them and understand how they work. Here are some of the top questions you should ask:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2315 aligncenter" src="https://losangelesgeneralcontractor.com//nas/content/live/joelco/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/hiring-a-contractor.jpg" alt="hiring a contractor" width="810" height="608" srcset="https://joelco.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/hiring-a-contractor.jpg 810w, https://joelco.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/hiring-a-contractor-300x225.jpg 300w, https://joelco.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/hiring-a-contractor-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have an <a href="https://losangelesgeneralcontractor.com/company/">established process</a> for completing work on budget and on time?</li>
<li>How many home remodels, and specifically room additions have you done this year?</li>
<li>Are you familiar with the permitting process locally?</li>
<li>Will you be in charge of doing building inspections and approvals?</li>
<li>What separates you from other contractors?</li>
<li>Do you offer a warranty after the room addition is complete?</li>
</ul>
<p>Expect a professional room addition contractor in Los Angeles to provide clear answers to these questions. Contractors who have been around for many years will have an established project management process that ensures your project is completed on time and within your budget.</p>
<p><strong>Obtain a Written Contract</strong></p>
<p>The final thing to consider before hiring a room addition contractor is obtaining a written contract. The document should include crucial details like the contractor’s name and license, the work to be done, the projected timeline for project completion, payment information and other important details about the project. Make sure to read the written contract carefully and ask any questions that you have before signing it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Building your dream home is an opportunity to meet your exact design and usability requirements. But building a home from scratch can be a daunting task, especially when it comes to finding a suitable plot of land and the construction costs. If you’re thinking about building a house in Los Angeles, you’ll want to look at the various factors that come into play when it comes to building your own home.</p>
<p>Homeowners across the country report the average cost of building a new house is $282,189 which would mean that a 2000 sq foot home would cost about $150 per sq foot. This can obviously vary greatly with all the additional cost variables involved. Here’re what you should know about building your own home before breaking ground.</p>
<p><strong>Cost Estimates of Building a Home in Los Angeles</strong></p>
<p>The cost of single-family or detached homes will vary based on the construction of the building, lot size, construction material, and the location. For detached homes that are often standalone structures, the cost of construction can’t be compared to duplex or townhomes. Let’s have a look at the average costs of building custom, prefabricated, and development homes.</p>
<p><em>Custom Homes</em></p>
<p>While <a href="https://losangelesgeneralcontractor.com/custom-home-builder/">building a custom home in Los Angeles</a> allows you to meet your specific functionality and aesthetic needs, the construction and decor options associated with custom home building can be costly in terms of money and time invested. Hiring the services of a residential architect and team of designers and custom home builders in Los Angeles can make the cost go even higher. The average cost of a custom home is between $350,00 and $1.5 million.</p>
<p>Due to the wide range of options available when it comes to building a custom house, estimating costs can be hard. Generally, the costs range between $100 to $400 per square foot. Materials and building location will also determine the overall cost of building a house in Los Angeles. If you’re considering building a custom home, <a href="https://losangelesgeneralcontractor.com/contact/">contact our team</a> to ensure you’re getting the best craftsmanship at the best price.</p>
<p><em>Prefabricated and Modular Homes</em></p>
<p>If you’re considering going for prefabricated homes, you’ll not enjoy the design options provided with custom home building. However, prefab homes cost around 10 to 20% less than custom homes. When it comes to prefab homes, you have to choose between panel building and modular building options. Talk to your home designer or prefab home builder to discuss the options available based on your needs.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2245 aligncenter" src="https://losangelesgeneralcontractor.com//nas/content/live/joelco/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/modular-homes.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="731" srcset="https://joelco.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/modular-homes.jpg 1024w, https://joelco.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/modular-homes-300x214.jpg 300w, https://joelco.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/modular-homes-768x548.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Modular homes provide additional design options than homes built using panels. Panels are cheaper than modules when it comes to transporting them on site. However, most people are combining both modular and panel construction to achieve designs that are not available in both type of constructions when it comes to building a house in Los Angeles. Prefab and modular homes range from $50,000 to $300,000.</p>
<p><em>Developers or Custom Home Builders </em></p>
<p>You can also opt for residential developers or custom home builders. Housing developments come with a high degree of customization but are usually limited to specific locations and floorplans. Normally, development homes are usually part of pre-planned community developments. Pricing often ranges depending on the target market. Housing developments are often more affordable than custom homes, with up to 15% savings in construction costs. Development homes cost between $50,000 and $1.5 million.</p>
<p><strong>Material and Machine Costs</strong></p>
<p>The materials you’ll use for home construction will determine the overall cost of construction. The size and type of home will also determine the cost of the materials. The exact location you’re building a house in Los Angeles may also affect the cost of materials. Architects and custom home builders in Los Angeles should be able to give you an accurate estimate of the cost of materials based on the design of your home.</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind machine costs based on what your builders own and what will need to be hired. Building on hilly or rocky areas will need specialized machinery, which increases costs. Most builders use backhoes which come equipped with the necessary attachments needed to work on your construction project. The average cost of hiring a backhoe ranges from $70 to $90 per hour.</p>
<p><strong>Labor Costs Involved</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2244 aligncenter" src="https://losangelesgeneralcontractor.com//nas/content/live/joelco/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/labor-costs.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="706" srcset="https://joelco.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/labor-costs.jpg 960w, https://joelco.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/labor-costs-300x221.jpg 300w, https://joelco.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/labor-costs-768x565.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></p>
<p>When it comes to labor costs, a number of factors come into play such as your <a href="https://losangelesgeneralcontractor.com/general-contractors/">Los Ageles general contractor</a> and the complexity and size of your home construction project. Large custom build homes will cost you more in labor costs than smaller modular homes. You have to factor in the costs of hiring the different professionals needed to carry out your project including architects, designers, engineers, and surveyors into your budget. At Joel &amp; Co. Construction, we offer design and structural engineering services in addition to residential construction services, which can <a href="https://losangelesgeneralcontractor.com/services/">help you save</a> hundreds, or even thousands, of dollars.</p>
<p>The labor costs associated with every stage of building a house in Los Angeles may also vary. Below is an average of what you should expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foundation (Excavation, pouring, and backfilling) &#8211; $4,000 &#8211; $12,000</li>
<li>Framing, trusses, and other metal work &#8211; $1,500 &#8211; $6,500</li>
<li>Exterior finishing including walls, roofing, windows, and doors &#8211; $40,000 &#8211; $60,000</li>
<li>Major home system installations like plumbing, HVAC, and electrical &#8211; $30,000 &#8211; $50,000</li>
<li>Interior finishing like drywall, painting, insulation, lighting, appliances, and flooring &#8211; upwards of $85,000</li>
</ul>
<p>Other final details need to be considered, including preparation for moving in, actual moving costs, and additions like landscaping, patios, decks, driveways, walkways, and cleanup.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Factors that Can Affect the Overall Home Building Cost</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2241 aligncenter" src="https://losangelesgeneralcontractor.com//nas/content/live/joelco/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/additional-home-building-costs.jpg" alt="" width="1629" height="1080" srcset="https://joelco.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/additional-home-building-costs.jpg 1629w, https://joelco.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/additional-home-building-costs-300x199.jpg 300w, https://joelco.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/additional-home-building-costs-768x509.jpg 768w, https://joelco.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/additional-home-building-costs-1024x679.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1629px) 100vw, 1629px" /></p>
<p>There are numerous factors that can affect the final cost of building a house in Los Angeles. Here’s a list of additional factors that you should keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Land and excavation &#8211; Preparing the land for home construction can be a significant cost. In most developments, the land is already prepared for construction works. If you’re planning to buy your plot, you’ll have to hire a building pro to clear it and do excavation work.</li>
<li>House size and shape &#8211; A bigger house in terms of square footage will cost you more. The more corners your home also has, the more money you’ll have to pay.</li>
<li>Number of stories &#8211; Additional stories will need additional design and build work, meaning increased building costs.</li>
<li>Type of roof &#8211; If you’re opting for specialty roofs, expect to pay more for installation and upkeep than the normal asphalt roofs. Durability is key when selecting a roof for your home.</li>
<li>Finishes/fixtures &#8211; The quality of fixtures you decide to install will also affect the overall cost. High-end options like marble floors and granite countertops are costly. Go for materials that meet your budgetary needs and aesthetic appeal.</li>
<li>Home design features &#8211; Do you want an outdoor kitchen, pool, or a large deck? Additional home design features will cost you more money but can greatly increase the value of your home.</li>
<li>Home appliances &#8211; Major appliances like washers and refrigerators can add significant costs to your budget unless you already you own such appliances.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Simple Checklist for Building a House in Los Angeles</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create an inclusive budget while factoring in the above points</li>
<li>Purchase a suitable plot of land within a good location</li>
<li>Choose the best and the most affordable construction method for your home</li>
<li>Develop the right building plans and designs with your building pro</li>
<li>Obtain the right building permits and inspections</li>
<li>Purchase home construction insurance</li>
<li>Begin your home construction project</li>
<li>Book a final inspection of your home</li>
<li>Complete landscaping and other small additions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why You Should Work with Custom Home Builders</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2243 aligncenter" src="https://losangelesgeneralcontractor.com//nas/content/live/joelco/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/custom-home-building.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://joelco.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/custom-home-building.jpg 1920w, https://joelco.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/custom-home-building-300x169.jpg 300w, https://joelco.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/custom-home-building-768x432.jpg 768w, https://joelco.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/custom-home-building-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>Building a home is no easy fit. It requires a lot of planning, research and, of course, the right building pros to guide you from the pre-construction stage to design &amp; build and project completion. While building a house from scratch can be expensive, more homeowners are considering custom home design &amp; build options.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Start the new year with a “new home”! Schedule renovations or remodeling efforts to beautify your home, make it more comfortable and functional, and increase curb appeal. Consider any of the following ideas before contacting the Los Angeles general contractors at Joel &amp; Co. Construction.</p>
<p><strong>Room Addition</strong></p>
<p>Add a room to your home or an apartment above your garage. Make it a guest room, exercise room, meditation room, or anything else that piques your interest and is useful. Talk to your <a href="https://losangelesgeneralcontractor.com/wordpress/room-additions/">Los Angeles remodeling contractors</a> to create something your whole family will love.</p>
<p>Kitchen Renovation Or Remodel</p>
<p>Renovate your kitchen this new year via cabinet and fixture upgrades, a new backsplash, new hardware, etc. Go a step further if you desire with remodeling. Consider adding a highly-functional kitchen island, expanding the room to provide more counter space and add appliances such as a dishwasher, or creating a breakfast nook that includes a table and plenty of comfy chairs.</p>
<p>Bathroom Renovation Or Remodel</p>
<p>Give your bathroom a facelift with a new coat or paint or new wallpaper. Replace outdated fixtures and a broken-down vanity, and consider refinishing your bathtub or shower. Other small changes include new shelving and towel racks. Remodel your bathroom to provide room for a spa tub as well as a shower, or to expand the space so you can add a second sink.</p>
<p>Hardwood Floors</p>
<p>Take up the old carpet or other old flooring to reveal the beautiful hardwood floors underneath. Hardwood flooring is hypoallergenic, easy to clean and maintain, durable, and simply beautiful. Don’t go another year dealing with old carpeting full of dust and other allergens. Refinish the hardwood flooring in your home to increase its beauty and asking price.</p>
<p>Discuss these and other home improvement ideas with the friendly team at Joel &amp; Co. Construction!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maintain your HVAC system to extend its life, lower your energy bills, and reduce your carbon footprint. Work with the talented Los Angeles general contractors at Joel &amp; Co. Construction for professional <a href="https://losangelesgeneralcontractor.com/wordpress/services/">HVAC maintenance and repair services</a>, and practice the following to avoid expensive, premature replacements.</p>
<p><strong>Clean &amp; Change The Filter</strong></p>
<p>Check your furnace filter regularly, preferably before you turn it on for the season. Clogged filters severely decrease energy efficiency, resulting in higher utility bills. Clean the filter every month and replace it as necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Inspect The Belt</strong></p>
<p>Inspect your furnace fan belt assuming you have an electric blower model. Check the belt on a yearly basis for cleanliness and to make certain it is tight and damage-free. Replace the belt with the same-size model if it is worn out, or have your <a href="https://losangelesgeneralcontractor.com/wordpress/kitchen-and-bathroom-remodel-los-angeles-ca/">Los Angeles building contractors</a> do it for you.</p>
<p><strong>Look For Signs Of Poor Combustion</strong></p>
<p>Identify signs of poor combustion, such as a burner flame that’s yellow or inconsistent instead of blue. Soot buildup is another sign of faulty combustion. If you discover either or both of these issues, call your general contractors right away. It could be a sign of carbon monoxide.</p>
<p><strong>Commission An Annual Maintenance Check</strong></p>
<p>Schedule a professional maintenance check every year to keep your HVAC system in good working condition. Skipping annual maintenance checks can end up costing you serious money, because any small issues will likely morph into huge, expensive headaches. Annual maintenance is an essential preventative measure that saves money and sidesteps premature HVAC system death.</p>
<p>Stay aware of strange noises coming from your HVAC system as well, as they are often signs of component damage or parts breaking down.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Refinishing your hardwood floors is generally less expensive than replacing them. It is arguably the more time-consuming project because it requires use of sanders, buffers, edgers, base coat sealers, brushes, putty knives, and topcoat sealers. Refinishing takes about four or five days and the floor cannot be walked upon during that time. Replacement takes less time because it mainly involves putting new lumber down. If you cannot decide whether refinishing or replacing your hardwood flooring is best, use the following tips from your<a href="https://losangelesgeneralcontractor.com/wordpress/"> Los Angeles building contractors </a>to make your decision.</p>
<p><strong>Severe Water Damage</strong></p>
<p>Serious water damage may call for flooring replacements. Cracking and peeling are two signs of water damage, while buckling is the most severe sign of damage. Contact your <a href="https://losangelesgeneralcontractor.com/wordpress/general-contractors/">Los Angeles general contractors</a> to determine if the wood can be salvaged or if total replacement is required.</p>
<p><strong>Age</strong></p>
<p>The age of your hardwood flooring indicates whether refinishing or replacement is best. For example, if the flooring is over 100 years old, is soft and bouncy, and has been refinished five or more times, replacement is the better option.</p>
<p><strong>Wood Species</strong></p>
<p>If you would like to change the species of wood, replacement is best. Perhaps you want something classic such as oak, or would prefer an exotic species such as Brazilian cherry. If replacing hardwood flooring is not in your budget, keep in mind refinishing the floors is also a way to change their appearance. Change the color, texture, and overall “look” of the floors with refinishing.</p>
<p><strong>Time</strong></p>
<p>As previously mentioned, refinishing takes more time than replacing. If budget constraints are not an issue and you would rather have the job done quickly, opt for replacement.</p>
<p>Discuss refinishing versus replacing hardwood flooring with your general contractors today!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are re-imagining your kitchen or bathroom and have yet to decide on countertops, consider the granite option. Granite countertop installation is one of the many services available through the <a href="https://losangelesgeneralcontractor.com/wordpress/">Los Angeles general contractors</a> at Joel &amp; Co. Construction. Take a moment to learn what makes granite a superior countertop choice before discussing ideas with the bathroom and kitchen remodeling experts.</p>
<p><strong>Unique</strong></p>
<p>Choose granite countertops knowing your selected slabs are completely unique. No two slabs of granite are the same, with each featuring its own swirls, fissures, and veins. Hundreds of color choices are available as well. You therefore do not have to worry about seeing your exact countertops in a friend or family member’s home.</p>
<p><strong>Durable</strong></p>
<p>Enjoy the supreme durability of granite. It is one of the hardest materials the natural world has to offer, and is both heat and scratch-resistant. Granite holds up against bathroom and kitchen activities that would damage lesser materials. For example, you can place hot kitchen appliances such as toaster ovens and griddles on granite without worrying about burning it. It is also resistant to moisture, unlike vinyl countertops. Vinyl countertops eventually succumb to moisture by separating and allowing even more water to seep through. Granite is immune to acid damage as well.</p>
<p><strong>Bacteria-Resistant</strong></p>
<p>Perform messy kitchen tasks with raw meat and the like without worrying about bacteria hanging around. Granite is a sanitary countertop material that does not harbor bacteria and germs.</p>
<p><strong>Classic</strong></p>
<p>Revel in the timelessness of granite countertops. They remain a classic countertop option that will look just as lovely 10 or 20 years from now.</p>
<p><strong>Easy To Maintain</strong></p>
<p>Keep granite clean with a few easy steps. Simply spray a recommended cleaner, let it stand for 15 to 30 seconds, then scrub granite with a sponge. Finish by buffing the countertop with a clean rag or paper towel.</p>
<p>Granite is clearly a wonderful countertop choice!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new roof could be exactly what your home needs this new year. Numerous warning signs indicate it’s time for roof replacement instead of repair. Work with the talented <a href="https://losangelesgeneralcontractor.com/wordpress/">Los Angeles general contractors</a> at Joel &amp; Co. Construction to obtain the new roof your home requires. You will decrease your energy bills in addition to increasing your home’s value!</p>
<p>Keep the following warning signs in mind:</p>
<p><strong>Missing, Broken, And Curled Shingles</strong></p>
<p>What is the status of your roof shingles? Missing, curled, and broken shingles in high numbers generally point to roof replacement. A few curled or broken shingles are easy enough to repair, however a multitude of damaged shingles is cause for concern. The same is true if you notice an increasing number of shingles scattered around your home.</p>
<p><strong>Sagging Roof</strong></p>
<p>A sagging roof is a serious issue that should never be ignored. It indicates a structural problem that could result in a full or partial collapse. Don’t gamble with the contents of your home and the people who live there&#8211;work with your <a href="https://losangelesgeneralcontractor.com/wordpress/services/">Los Angeles remodeling contractors</a> to identify the cause of the sag and commission the necessary replacement.</p>
<p><strong>Age</strong></p>
<p>How old is your roof? An asphalt shingle roof that’s more than 20 years old should be replaced. Shingle roofs do not last more than 25 years, with 30 years an example of “pushing it.” A metal roof lasts for as long as 50 years, so consider replacing your current roof with a metal option if it suits your home’s aesthetic.</p>
<p><strong>Sunlight In The Attic</strong></p>
<p>Sunlight streaming through your attic ceiling boards is never a good thing. If sunlight can stream through, so can rain and snow. When left unchecked, you’re looking at water damage, rot, and mold and mildew formation. Get your roof replaced to avoid all of these issues.</p>
<p>Other signs your roof needs replacing include shingle granules in your gutters, roof valleys, and severely-damaged flashing. <a href="https://losangelesgeneralcontractor.com/wordpress/contact/">Contact</a> the Los Angeles general contractors at Joel &amp; Co. Construction today to schedule a consultation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If replacing your current bathroom backsplash is on your to-do list, allow your <a href="https://losangelesgeneralcontractor.com/wordpress/bathroom-remodeling/">Los Angeles bathroom remodeling </a>experts help. Joel &amp; Co. Construction specializes in bathroom backsplashes among many other services, and will happily install something new and refreshing. Check out the following ideas to inspire your bathroom remodeling efforts this season.</p>
<p><strong>Mismatched Tile</strong></p>
<p>Use reclaimed tile pieces to create a beautifully-mismatched bathroom backsplash. The result will be one-of-a-kind and something everyone who wanders into your wash room will comment on. Find pieces featuring colorful patterns and designs, and don’t forget to use a variety of sizes for added effect.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth Stones</strong></p>
<p>Create a backsplash with found objects, such as smooth stones from your backyard. Again, different sizes and colors will only add to the stunning result. Stick to smooth stones to avoid freak hand injuries, and feel free to paint them if you want. Add your children’s names to the stones, paint them a variety of colors, or opt for unique patterns and designs.</p>
<p><strong>Maps</strong></p>
<p>Reuse old maps to create a backsplash that’s also a geography lesson. Use laminate materials for obvious reasons, and try to craft a backsplash that features all seven continents. Maps of specific countries also works well. This is a great idea for a children’s bathroom!</p>
<p><strong>Pennies</strong></p>
<p>Try working with coinage! Pennies are an increasingly-popular kitchen backsplash, however they work just as well in the bathroom. Again, some kind of laminate or other protective material is necessary to avoid a rust-tastic bathroom wall.</p>
<p><strong>Placemats</strong></p>
<p>Find interesting placemats to make a unique bathroom backsplash. This is another idea that works very well in the kitchen, however it still functions as a unusual bathroom option. Look for placemats in a variety of shapes and sizes for best results.</p>
