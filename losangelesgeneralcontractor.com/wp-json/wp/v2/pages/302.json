Some of these responsibilities include directing specialized tradespeople such as electricians and plumbers, coordinating with material suppliers, and most importantly, communicating with the client.

This regulation is in place to ensure the safety of homeowners and their investments.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At Joel &amp; Co.
