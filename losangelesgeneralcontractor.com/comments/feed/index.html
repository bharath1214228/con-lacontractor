					<description><![CDATA[Our roof is peaking at 20 years and you&#039;re right about the age. we&#039;ve had many shingles replaced over the last 5 years and we&#039;re ready for a new roof at this point! Plus, we&#039;re looking to sell our home and will need the replacement regardless. Even though the cost up front is quite an investment,  it&#039;ll add value to our house and we&#039;ll be able to gain even more of a profit for doing so.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for pointing out that a sagging roof is a sign of a structural problem that must never be ignored as it can cause troubles for the house. I will mention this to my mom since I did notice that the roof is sagging on the left side of the house. It actually looks weird. I just hope that the roof can still be repaired since the holidays are coming and we have nowhere else to stay.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[THIS WAS A GRATE  INFORMATIVE POST YOU HAVE SHARED ON THIS PAGE ABOUT THE BUILDING OF HOUSE IN LOS ANGELES When it comes to labor costs, a number of factors come into play such as your Los Ageles general contractor and the complexity and size of your home construction project. Large custom build homes will cost you more in labor costs than smaller modular homes. You have to factor in the costs of hiring the different professionals needed to carry out your project including architects, designers, engineers, and surveyors into your budget. At Joel &#038; Co. Construction, we offer design and structural engineering services in addition to residential construction services, which can help you save hundreds, or even thousands, of dollars.
The labor costs associated with every stage of build .
Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You made a good point when you said that I must not ignore it when light enters the attic because that means that rain and snow can get through it as well. I never actually thought about how serious the situation was until you pointed that out. And since there are a lot of holes in the roof that are letting the sunlight in, I know there is a lot of access to water and snow as well. I will call a roofing contractor to fix the issue or maybe replace the roof.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It got me on high alert when you said that a saggy roof is a problem that can cause a structural problem and can result in partial or full collapse if ignored. I will be sure to call a professional to check the roof as soon as I can since the roof is partly saggy. My brothers won&#039;t even go to the part of the house where the sagging roof is leaning towards out of fear that it will fall on them. I guess they were right.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for pointing out that an asphalt shingle roofing does not last for more than 25 years, so in case it ever starts reaching that age, we need to consider replacing it. If that is the case, then I need to call a professional to have the roof checked and schedule a replacement. I am sure we need a new one installed since the roof was being used for more than 23 years now. I am not waiting for it to give out first before having it replaced.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been debating for some time now whether or not the roof needs to be replaced, and this article answered my question. You said that if more than one shingle on the roof is damaged, it needs to be replaced as it indicates that it is nearing the end of its lifespan. If so, then I need to replace the roof since the gutters, pavement, and garden bed are littered with shingle granules.]]></description>
